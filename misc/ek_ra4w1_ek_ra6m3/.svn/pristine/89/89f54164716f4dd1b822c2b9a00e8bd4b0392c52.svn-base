      description: |
        PIO pin configuration for SCI & SCI signals.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Renesas SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>.

        For example the UART on RA would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&p206_uart_urxd &p205_uart_utxd>;
